# Banner Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder SVG files for banners.

To convert these SVG files to actual images:
1. Open each SVG file in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the page
3. Save the screenshot as a JPG or PNG with the same name (e.g., banner-1.jpg)

Or use a tool like html2canvas or a screenshot service to automate this process.
